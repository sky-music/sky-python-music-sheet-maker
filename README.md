This program lets you make visual music sheets for Sky: Children of the Light. It is written in Python and does not require previous knowledge of the command line to run. 

As well as using QWERT ASDFG ZXCVB keys as the keyboard, there are other supported notations:

- Sky notation (A1 A2 A3 A4 A5, B1 B2 B3 B4 B5, C1 C2 C3 C4 C5)
- English notation (C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, B4)
- Jianpu (1 2 3 4 5 6 7, followed by + or - for octaves)
- French do ré mi
- Japanese do ré mi

You can type these in the command line, or save in a text file and import it. 

The output will be HTML, with small icons of the Sky keyboard. If you use Western notation or Jianpu notation, it will also convert to Sky notation for you in a txt file.
