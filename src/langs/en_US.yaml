      Pay attention to these special characters:
      - Notes composing a chord must be glued together (e.g. A1B1C1).
      - Separate chords with "{icon_delimiter}".
      - Use "{pause}" for a silence (rest), except for Jianpu where '0' is the official pause character.
      - Use "{quaver_delimiter}" to link notes within an icon, for triplets, quavers... (e.g. {quaver_example}). With Jianpu, use "{jianpu_quaver_delimiter}" instead of "-" to avoid confusion with the octave.
      - Add "{repeat_indicator}" after a chord to indicate repetition.
      - Sharps "#" and flats "b" (semitones) are supported for Western and Jianpu notations.
