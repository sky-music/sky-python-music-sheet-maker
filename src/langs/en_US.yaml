      Pay attention to these special characters:
      - Notes composing a chord must be glued together (e.g. A1B1C1).
      - Separate chords with "{icon_delimiter}".
      - Use "{pause}" for a silence (rest), except for Jianpu where '0' is the official pause character.
      - Use "{quaver_delimiter}" to link notes within an icon, for triplets, quavers... (e.g. {quaver_example}). With Jianpu, use "{jianpu_quaver_delimiter}" instead of "-" to avoid confusion with the octave.
      - Add "{repeat_indicator}" after a chord to indicate repetition.
      - Sharps "#" and flats "b" (semitones) are supported for Western and Jianpu notations.

    afterword:
    input_tip: Type the key name
    help_text: |
      Sky''s musical system does not include semitones. It is like removing all the black keys on the piano. Hence some songs cannot be played in the Home Sanctuary exactly as they sound in the outside world. You have to shift their frequencies before using this program, or play in other locations of Sky where the notes have been shifted on the keyboard. This is called transposition or 'changing the song key'.
      Hopefully, we have detected that your song can be played in several song keys available in Sky. Please choose the one that is most convenient for you.

    help_text: |
      You have used a musical notation that does impose the exact pitch of the notes.
      Hence the visual sheet will sound differently in different places in Sky.  This is called transposition.
  octave_shift:
    foreword: Do you want to shift the pitch of your notes?
    question: 'Octave shift ({skip_number} to skip)'
    afterword:
    input_tip: octave shift as an integer between -6 and +6
    help_text: |
      A musical note is uniquely identified by its name (within an octave), and an octave number. Sky's music system spans less than 3 octaves.
      If you do not specify an octave number after a note, we will assume it is the first octave of Sky, so your notes will essential by played near the bass.
      You can shift your notes to a higher (lower) pitch by setting a positive (negative) number in this field.
