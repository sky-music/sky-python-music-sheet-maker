This style sheet is essential to the Music Sheet Maker program, for:
* HTMl output
* SVG output
* building the PNG elements

It should NOT be tempered with or moved.

The only reason for which a non-advanced user may want to modify this CSS is to change the note size in html or svg output.
In this case he has 2 options:

1) Change the 'font-size' value of the 'body' element. This will resize *all* the elements in the page.
2) Change the 'font-size' value of the 'td' element. This will resize notes without affecting text.
