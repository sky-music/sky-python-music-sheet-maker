The SVG folder contains a subfolder for each color theme used in the program.
Each theme folder contains all the necessary SVG templates for this theme. Currently, there is only template.svg

Each folder must contain a __init__.py file because they are imported as modules.

The only reason for which an advanced user may want to modify these SVG templates is to change colors, font size, or the note size in html or svg output.
