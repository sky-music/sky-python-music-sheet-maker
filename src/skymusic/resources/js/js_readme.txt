This folder contains javascripts that can be included in the HTML visual sheets.

They will be entirely embedded in the HTML code, to be run offline (on the local drive of a  computer for instance).

The scripts names must be defined in Resources.py in the offline_scripts_urls list.

Online scripts used by sky-music.github.io are defined in inline_scripts_urls, and are stored in the /js directory of this project.
