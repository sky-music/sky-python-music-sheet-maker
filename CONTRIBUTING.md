# Contributing

Contributions are welcomed from everyone. However, please adhere by the following guidelines if possible when submitting a Github Pull Request and working on the codebase for the sky-python-music-sheet-maker project:

## Pull requests and commits

* All **pull requests**(PRs) and **commits** should be against the `dev` branch, and after further testing and validation will be merged into the `master` branch by the maintainers.
* When filing a **pull request**(PR), please thoroughly test the changes and if possible provide a brief description on the changes. (This helps the maintainers and other contributors to verify the commits as we do not have a CI/CD system in-place)

***

## Codebase

* New additions to the codebase that are not classes should use a *CamelCase* naming scheme.
* Otherwise class implementations should use a *flat case* nameing scheme separated by hyphens when appropriate.
